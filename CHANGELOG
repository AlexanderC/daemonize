Changes in version 1.1:

- Now uses local getopt.c unconditionally, instead of defaulting to
  whatever's on the system. This gets around a problem when installing on
  systems with GNU getopt (e.g., Linux). Unless POSIXLY_CORRECT is set in
  the environment, GNU getopt scans the entire command line, which means
  it'll complain about "unknown options" that are specified in the command
  being passed to daemonize. One solution is to have daemonize set
  POSIXLY_CORRECT right before calling getopt() (and then restore it before
  running the program-to-daemonize, in case it might affect that program's
  behavior). However, it's just simpler to use the old, public domain
  getopt routine.

- daemonize now verifies that the program actually exists before
  daemonizing. (It didn't check before.)
